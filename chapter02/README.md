# Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn the pattern from the data and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. 



ðŸ’« **Types of learning algorithms:**

- Supervised learning (classification and regression)
- Unsupervised learning (Clustering)
- Semi-supervised learning
- Reinforcement learning ( game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms)
