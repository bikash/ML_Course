# Pre-Processing

Data preprocessing involves the transformation of the raw dataset into an understandable format. 
Preprocessing data is a fundamental stage in data mining to improve data efficiency.
The data preprocessing methods directly affect the outcomes of any analytic algorithm.

ðŸ’« **Steps In Data Preprocessing:**

- Gathering the data
- Import the dataset & Libraries
- Dealing with Missing Values
- Divide the dataset into Dependent & Independent variable
- dealing with Categorical values
- Split the dataset into training and test set
- Feature Scaling


***1. Gathering the data***
Data is raw information, its the representation of both human and machine observation of the world. Dataset entirely depends on what type of problem you want to solve. Each problem in machine learning has its own unique approach.
